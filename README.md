#Intro to Angular 2

Open the root of this project in a local webserver. I use "live-server" which you can install
with `npm install live-server -g`.

The TypeScript transpilation occurs in the browser, so the TypeScript compiler is not needed.
If you use WebStorm and it prompts to compile the files for you, just say "no".
